# Johnson-Discord-Bot
Personal discord.py bot, used on my friend's server. not really set up for external use
Honestly, this is just setup for heroku auto-deploy but feel free to look at the code

## Functions
Currently, this bot can do a number of things:

  * Allow you to play Rock Paper Scissors with a another discord user
  
  * Be a dollar-store Dad Bot
  
  * Be the ADL
  
  * Keep track of a server currency, "V-Bucks," as well as sever experience and your Level
  
  * Can respond to a number of certain phrases / Become a sleeper agent
  
  * Roll any number die
  
  * Gamble, but without the risk
  
  * Maybe more, idk
