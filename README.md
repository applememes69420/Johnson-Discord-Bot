# Johnson-Discord-Bot
Personal discord.py bot, used on my friend's server. Please don't use this as a guide

Currently, this bot can do a number of things:

  Allow you to play Rock Paper Scissors with a another discord user
  
  Be a dollar-store Dad Bot
  
  Be the ADL
  
  Keep track of a server currency, "V-Bucks," as well as sever experience and your Level
  
  Can respond to a number of certain phrases / Become a sleeper agent
  
  Roll any number die
  
  Gamble, but without the risk
  
  Maybe more, idk
  
All of the user info -- exp, level, vbucks -- is all stored on a MongoDB database cluster. If you were to use this bot, you'd have to setup your own database. 

Just make your own bot, for your own sake.
